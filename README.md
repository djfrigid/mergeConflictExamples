Some text: 
Throughout the series, Harry is described as having **his father's perpetually untidy black hair**, his mother's bright green eyes, and a lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. He is further described as "small and skinny for his age" with "a thin face" and "knobbly knees", and he wears Windsor glasses.
